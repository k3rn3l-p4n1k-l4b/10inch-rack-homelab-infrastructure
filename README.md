# Dual-Rack Homelab Infrastructure

This repository documents a multi-server home lab designed to simulate real-world IT infrastructure, lifecycle management, and operational scenarios. 

To maintain uptime for live services while allowing total freedom to experiment, the infrastructure is split across **two separate physical environments**:

*   **Production Host (19-Inch Rack):** A full-sized rack deployment running Proxmox VE. This environment hosts stable, everyday infrastructure services that require high availability, such as identity management, core networking services, central storage, and automated backup routines.
*   **Tinker & Lab Host (10-Inch Rack):** A compact, space-constrained physical 10-inch rack deployment. This serves as a dedicated hardware sandbox used to safely build, break, and test configurations—including custom security policies, intrusion prevention, and incident response simulations.

While this repository documents projects built across both form factors, **completed implementations span across both environments** depending on their current operational purpose. This dual-rack setup provides a safe, realistic simulation of staging systems across separate development and production baselines.
